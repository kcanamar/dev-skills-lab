# My Developer Skills Lab


<br>



## Introduction

This lab provides an opportunity to practice working with the DOM.

This lab is **BONUS**.

<br>


### Setup  

1. Create a folder called `dev-skills-lab` 
- Inside of `dev-skills-lab` create the following folder/file structure:

```shell
dev-skills-lab/
  index.html
  css/
   style.css
  js/
   script.js
```


2. Do the usual when setting up a front-end project:
	- Add the HTML boilerplate to `index.html`
	- Link in `./js/script.js` - don't forget the `defer` attribute!
	- Link in `./css/script.css`

3. You'll want to create a repo for this assignment on [Github Enterprise](https://git.generalassemb.ly) or on your [Github](https://github.com)


4. Code away!

### Requirements

1. Add HTML and CSS as necessary to implement an application that looks close to this wire frame:

	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k06ZMEN.png">
	
2. Code the following _user stories_, using jQuery where possible:

	- As a User (AAU), I don't want to see any developer skills when the page first loads so that I can start with a fresh slate.

	- AAU, I want to be able to type in a skill and have it added to my list of skills by clicking a button.

	- AAU, I want to be able to remove an individual skill one at a time in case I make a mistake.

## Bonus


<br>

##### Replace the first user story above with the following story:

- AAU, I want to see my previous list of developer skills so that I can start from where I last left off.

##### Hint:

- Research [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) as a way to persist (remember) the developer skills each time they are updated.
